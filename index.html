          <p>
            I'm currently self-studying CS and web development while working
            part-time and freelancing. If you have any suggestions for things to
            study or projects to try, let me know. My academic background is in
            linguistics and cogsci.

            For now, I'm focusing on web development in React with Typescript
            and doing some Odin Project to learn JS fundamentals as well. I also
            have some experience with Python, MATLAB, and R, in descending
            familiarity. I'm currently working through

            and want to learn Rust as well.
          </p>

            My current goal is to learn enough to build a web app-which might be
            hosted here later-to record

            attacks. As someone with the condition, I've found that it's
            difficult to explain the severity of the disruptions it creates. I
            want to create a solution that works for me, and that maybe can help
            others too.
