    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
    <p>I hope to use this to show what I'm working on.</p>
    <h2>What I'm doing right now:</h2>
    <p>
      I'm currently self-studying CS and web development while working part-time
      and freelancing. If you have any suggestions for things to study or
      projects to try, let me know. My academic background is in linguistics and
      cogsci.

      with Python, MATLAB, and R, in descending familiarity. I'm currently

      attacks. As someone with the condition, I've found that it's difficult to
      explain the severity of the disruptions it creates. I want to create a
      solution that works for me, and that maybe can help others too.
