        <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
        <p>This is a website I hope to use to show what I'm working on.</p>

            I'm currently self-studying CS while working part-time and
            freelancing. If you have any suggestions for things to study or
            projects to try, let me know.
