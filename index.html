        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
        <p>This is a website I hope to use to show what I'm working on.</p>
        <h2>What I'm doing:</h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently self-studying CS while working part-time and
            freelancing. If you have any suggestions for things to study or
            projects to try, let me know. My background is in linguistics and
            cogsci.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have some experience with Python, MATLAB, and R, in descending
            familiarity. I'm currently working on
            <a href="https://github.com/ossu/computer-science">OSSU</a> and want
            to learn Rust as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current goal is to learn enough to build a web app-which might be
            hosted here later-to record
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_headache"

            >
            attacks. As someone with the condition, I've found that it's
            difficult to explain the severity of the disruptions it creates. I
            want to create a solution that works for me, and that maybe can help
            others too.
        </p>
